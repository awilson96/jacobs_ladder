# App Requirments

- Need a page for visually displaying the keyboard with the currently held down notes highlighted in yellow
- Upon playing a chord, the other compatible scales should be highlighted in other colors depending on the scale that it belongs to
- On the right hand side there should be a drop down menu with all of the scales which are compatible with the currently selected notes
- Each element of the drop down menu should be clickable, where OnClick() the alternatively colored keys should be restricted only to that scale
- By default all colors should be displayed (i.e. Select all option is selected). This can be unselected and only certain classes of scales can be chosen
- This allows the user to select one, multiple, or all scales to be selected for highlighting the keys
- If there is overlap between the scales, then the keys should be varying shades of orange, the darker the shade the higher the degree of overlap
